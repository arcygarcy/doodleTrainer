ToontownRewritten Doodle Trainer V2

by Adam Garcia

This tool works by randomly generating a number in a range between the tricks desired. Additionally I 
have made features to avoid being detected right away by moderators. The toon will turn and jump as
well as say other phrases than tricks.

This is my tool to train doodles in ttr. When you open the .exe file you are prompted by 3 questions.

First, how long you would like to run the trainer, my reccomendation to avoid bans is to not exceed
more than 8 hours of usage at a time. I find it best to use it overnight and in the morning to exit
the game to avoid suspition.

Second, how many tricks you have. For example if the toon you are using only had jump and speak as tricks
you would put 2. What I have found from all my time playing is that Jump, Beg, and Speak are the best.
For this I usually create a new toon and gift them the tricks that I want to train, then set the number
of tricks to however many I have at the time.

Last, what row the pets tab is on. This will tell the bot what level to start using to be able to
click on the tricks. I recommend new toons for this as they are on row 2 and do not have any phrases or
unites that can be miscliked. I have had phrases clicked by accident before.

Things needed:
  -there is a C++ dependency that is needed for this to run properly. I can't remember which, but when
  you run it will say that you are missing someting, they you can do a google search, and download from
  Microsofts website.
