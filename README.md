ToontownRewritten Doodle Trainer V3

by Adam Garcia

This tool works by randomly generating a number in a range between the tricks desired. Additionally I 
have made features to avoid being detected right away by moderators. The toon will turn and jump as
well as say other phrases than tricks.

This is my tool to train doodles in ttr. When you open the .exe file you are prompted by 3 questions.

First, how long you would like to run the trainer, my reccomendation to avoid bans is to not exceed
more than 8 hours of usage at a time. I find it best to use it overnight and in the morning to exit
the game to avoid suspition.

Second, what row "Pets" tab in on, this make it so you can use toons with phrases and unites. Note:
if there in an event that there are 5 rows the promgram should still run fine.

Third, what tricks you want to use, enter the nuber of the trick you want followed by a space. These
are based on having all tricks unlocked, so make sure you have all tricks or you may encounter issues.

Lastly, it is still possible to get a temp ban from using this, I would reccomend that if you do want
to use this then you should make a new accound, and gift it the tricks you want to train. This would
avoid recieving a ban as well as any issues that you might have with speedchat alignment.
