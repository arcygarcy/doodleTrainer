# ToontownRewritten Doodle Trainer V4

This is a tool for using the speedchat ui in ToonTown to say tricks for your doodle to perform. This was made for educational purposes and to get a better understanding of python and these libraries.

## Prerequisites

Must be on a Windows based operating system.

To make your experience as seemless as possible I recommend that you have Python and Git installed on your machine.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Download Files via Releases Tab

-[Release v4.1](https://github.com/arcygarcy/doodleTrainer/releases/tag/v4.1)

Find the files in your downloads folder and extract the files.

Open the new folder, [Shift + Right Click] on a blank space in the folder and open with PowerShell.

You should see something like: ```C:\Users\user\Downloads\doodleTrainer``` and if so you are ready to move on.

## Virtual Environment(Optional)

This is good practice, but optional.

Create virtual Environment.

```python -m venv venv```

Activate virtual Environment.

```venv\Scripts\activate```

After you are done using the script you can leave the Virtual Environment with this command.

```deactivate```

## Install Dependencies

The dependencies need to be downloaded for this to work properly.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Start Script

```python doodleTrainer.py```

## Best Practices

I recommend that you do all the following to have the best experience with this tool.

- Only have 1 Toontown account running on the computer you are running the script on.
- Run the tool for no more than 8 hours at a time.
- Stand on the edge of a roof at your toon estate, this will stop doodle from pushing you around.
