# ToontownRewritten Doodle Trainer V4

This is a tool for using the speedchat ui in ToonTown to say tricks for your doodle to perform. This was made for educational purposes and to get a better understanding of python and these libraries.

## Prerequisites

Must be on a Windows based operating system.

To make your expirence as seemless as possible I recommend that you have Python and Git installed on your machine.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Clone the Repository

Open a command prompt, on windows you can simply press the windows key on your keyboard and type powershell.

```git clone https://github.com/arcygarcy/doodleTrainer.git```

Navigate to the directory.

```cd doodleTrainer```

## Virtual Enviornment(Optional)

This is good practice, but optional.

Create virtual enviornment.

```python -m venv venv```

Activate virtual enviornment.

```venv\Scripts\activate```

After you are done using the script you can leave the Virtual Enviornment with this command.

```deactivate```

## Install Dependencies

The dependencies need to be downloaded for this to work properly.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Start Script

```python doodleTrainer.py```

## Best Practices

I reccomend that you do all the following to have the best expireince with this tool.

- Only have 1 Toontown account running on the computer you are running the script on.
- Run the tool for no more than 8 hours at a time.
- Stand on the edge of a roof at your toon estate, this will stop doodle from pushing you around.
